	<h2>About Me</h2>
   	<p class="mainbody">Hello, thanks for taking the time to check out my page. My name is Michael Connor Craney and I am a Junior expecting a double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science
	at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2021. I'm originally from Batavia, Illinois which is a West Chicago Suburb. I created this website as a way to showcase my abilites related to my major in a more interesting way. Outside of the classroom I have many passions, including soccer, guitar, snowboarding, and nature. Included above is some photos of me snowboarding and from trips I've taken.</p>
   
        <h2>Major</h2><p>BS in Computer Engineering, BS in Computer Science</p>

	<h2>GPA</h2><p>3.568</p>

   	<h2>Languages</h2><p>Java, JavaFX, HTML, CSS, Python, C, Verilog</p>

   	<h2>Software</h2><p>MATLAB, Eclipse, intelliJ, Git, Github, Anaconda, Microsoft Office Suite, Quartus, ModelSim, AutoCAD, Photoshop, Lightroom</p>

   	<h2>WiscWind</h2>
   	<p class="wiscwind">I am a member of the UW-Madison WiscWind team which designs a Wind Turbine and competes in the Department of Energy Collegiate Wind Competition. For the 2019 competition I 
   	was the head of the Regulation portion of our circuit, which consisted of two buck-boost converters to deliver a constant power supply to our Arduino
   	and to our Battery. I also helped develop the safety breaking system which uses an Arduino to divert power to an energy dissapation portion of our board when the wind speeds are too high. We placed 7th of 12 overall this year, with a 4th place finish for design and 2nd place for the sitting test which tests the overall endurance of your wind turbine. We will learn from our mistakes and attempt to put together an even better turbine for next year.</p>

        <h2>Employment</h2>
	<p class="job">I work for the UW-Madison Department of Psychiatry as a Networking and IT specialist. We maintain the multiple networks throughout our building, provide trouble shooting for clinical and research psychologists technology needs, and also do a lot of website and database building and maintaining. This job has taught me how to work well with others, think critically under pressure, and how to work towards actively preventing problems instead of waiting for them to happen. It also has exposed me to a wider range of software, managing big data in the form of QNAPs for the research side of our Department, and setting up high network security since much of the information on our network pertains to HIPPA.</p>
