		   <td>Self Built Guitar Pedal</td>
		   <td>I ordered a DIY guitar pedal kit that came with a printed PCB and all the necessary components that you then solder together. It was 
			   not only a great learning experience but allows me to connect Computer Engineering to something I love, guitar.</td>
